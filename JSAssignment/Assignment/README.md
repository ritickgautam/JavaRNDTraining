Description:

·         There is an option to add a friend by clicking on the plus button on the top right.

·         All the details of the expenses are maintained in the below table. The expenses should always be in descending order of date. The expenses should be filterable according to the individual name selected. All the expense amounts in the table should be in only one currency.

 

Tasks:

1.      Validate the form using JS only

2.      Add error messages under each input with the class name ‘error-msg’.

3.      After adding a friend, the value should be inserted into the ‘Add friend’ select options. Trigger the add action on the ‘enter’ key press event.

4.      Append the expense details into the table after validating the form and set the input fields to default values.

5.      The expenses should be sorted always in the descending order of date(latest date first).

6.      All the expense amounts should be converted to a single currency which is selected in the filters bar.

7.      After selecting the edit option, the details should be filled into the form above, and the ‘Add a new expense’ header and ‘Add a new item' button text should be changed to ‘Edit expense’ and ‘Done’ respectively.
