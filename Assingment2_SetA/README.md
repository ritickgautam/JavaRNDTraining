#Core Java Assignment -2

 

 

SET A

Make a Parent class Currency. 
1.      Make Rupee, Dollar and Euro as the subclasses. Make conversion method as a base method in Currency class. 

2.      Override this conversion method in all the other classes (Rupee, Dollar & Euro).

3.      Make a parameterized constructor in individual derived subclasses which takes amount, as parameters and does the required conversion.

4.      Make another class “calculateCurrency” with overloaded parameterized constructors. These parameterized constructors take convertFrom, convertTo and Amount and calculates the currency.

5.       

Make use of Access Specifiers in the above program:
1.      Make the conversion method private in the parent class.

2.      Make the overridden methods public in the subclasses.
