SET B

Make a Parent class Shape. 
1.      Make Rectangle, Triangle and Square as the subclasses. Make calculateArea method as a base method in Shape class. 

2.      Override this conversion method in all the other classes (Rectangle, Triangle and Square).

3.      Make parameterized constructor in individual derived subclasses which takes calculation parameters (like length, breadth, height etc.) as parameters and does the area calculation.

4.      Make another class “calculateArea” with overloaded parameterized constructors. These parameterized constructors take shapeType and other parameters as length, breadth etc. and calculates the Area.

2.                  Make use of Access Specifiers in the above program:

            Make the calculateArea method private in the parent class.

            Make the overridden methods public in the subclasses.
